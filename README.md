## Git vs. GitHub
[Git](https://git-scm.com/docs) is a **verison control** system that keeps track of all the verisons(saves) in a file, and helps manange and organizes it.  

[Github](https://github.com/) is where you store all your files on a cloud, into a remote server, where it keeps track of the file, and allows anyone else to view and copy your file.

Git is used to help move files into or out of Github. Git tracks file verisons and files of all the changes you have mad overtime, while Github is just a open storage space for many different lamguauges of code.
